<ul>
<li>Define a&nbsp;<strong>template function&nbsp;</strong>called&nbsp;<strong>average</strong> that takes two template parameters: an iterable container type and a numeric type. This function should iterate through the container and find the average of its contents. The average should be returned as the same type specified.</li>
<li>Define a&nbsp;<strong>functor</strong> called&nbsp;<strong>Greater_than</strong> that takes a single template parameter: a type. It should have a single data member of the specified type that is initialized with the constructor. You must also define&nbsp;<strong>operator&nbsp;</strong><strong>( )</strong> which takes a single argument and returns true if the argument is greater than the data member; otherwise, return false.</li>
<li>You may write your templates directly in the provided main class.</li>
</ul>
