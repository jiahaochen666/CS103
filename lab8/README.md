<p><span>Instructions</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You are given a set number of Plants, each with a name and start and end months (represented as integers). Each plant can only grow beginning at its start month, or&nbsp;<strong>up to right before</strong> its end month.</li>
<li>Your task is to write a short program to place these Plants into the rows of a garden (represented as a 2D vector) such the minimum number of rows are used and no Plants in a given row have overlapping growth windows.</li>
<li>You will use a greedy algorithm by considering each Plant in order of start month and using the minimum of rows for this sequence. This should be done using a min-heap.</li>
<li>For this Lecture Activity, you should only use:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<em>for(auto)</em><span>&nbsp;</span>loops (no low-level for-loops)</li>
<li>
<em>while</em> loops</li>
<li>
<em>std::vector</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(no other data structures)</li>
<li>
<em>*_heap(</em> ) functions from <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/">&lt;algorithm&gt;</a>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
